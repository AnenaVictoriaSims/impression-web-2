How to use:
- Paste a URL to an image and  or choose an image from your device
- Sit tight for a few seconds as the data from the image to processed with Microsoft Cognitive Science API
- Results will be returned in a modal with a statement saying what it believe the image to be

**_(Disclaimer: not all results are correct, I do provide an accuracy score from the API with each result)_**

To develop:
- clone my repo or download zip
- navigate to directory (impression-web)
- either open index.html in your browser of choice or start a local server (python3 -m http.server)
- **no code compilation needed, you don't compile static HTML/CSS/JS lol.**

To contribute: 
- fork my repo
- create a new branch called "dev" or "development"
- make changes
- push changes to github
